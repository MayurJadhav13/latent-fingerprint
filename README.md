# purpose
This research aims to develop a rapid and efficient methodology for latent fingerprint recognition, addressing the challenge of high processing times in current approaches. The study explores the potential of one-shot and few-shot learning techniques in achieving accurate and computationally efficient latent fingerprint recognition.

#Data
The data is taken from the IIIT-D latent fingerprint dataset. The dataset contains 850 images of 3 groups. These 3 groups are IIITD Latent Mated 500ppi, IIITD Latent Mated 1000ppi, and IIITDLatentDatabase. The proposed solution is mainly on IIITD Latent Mated 1000ppi containing 254 images.

#Architecture

#Results 
In the few-shot learning of the prototypical network using the pre-trained DenseNet121 model, the research achieved a remarkable test accuracy of 91.66%. Additionally, both the F1 score and precision metrics are 93.32% & 93.93%, indicating the high performance of the proposed methodology in latent fingerprint recognition.
